# Static Comp Challenge: Choose Your Own Adventure

## Specification

This static comp challenge will keep you exercising that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: You will be asked to recreate the image below by recreating the screenshot using HTML and CSS.

Don't worry, we'll give you a bit of flexibility, however the objective is to build something that **very closely** represents the original design.

Once you get into the workforce, building out comps that reflect the designer's choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.

### Things to Note

- You will select a website you think is well designed, and recreate their homepage as closely as you possibly can.

### Base Requirements

- Basic static site setup with `index.html` and `styles.css`
- Submit your work through a PR
- In your PR comment or description, you must provide a link to the site you are recreating
